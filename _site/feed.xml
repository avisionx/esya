&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font-weight-light&quot;&gt;
Last year, we kick-started Esya with our very own rising star, Nitin Mandal for a comedy and fun filled night! 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font-weight-light&quot;&gt;
“For him, life is all about stories that make others laugh. Not that the highs and lows of finding his footing in the fledgeling field of stand-up comedy deterred 24-year-old Nitin Mandal. He literally laughed his way through and is today a well-known comedian in the Capital’s stand-up circuit.” -  Insider
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font-weight-light&quot;&gt;
“Being the badshaah of sarcasm, he can tickle your funny bone with his relationship stories and real-life experiences. Nitin has performed on the popular hit Red FM show Comedy ka Ghanta. His comedy sets come with a seatbelt warning though, because you may fall out of your seats laughing.” - BookMyShow
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font-weight-light&quot;&gt;
The experience, as all who attended would agree, was entertaining and filled with laughter all around. After the exhausting yet indulging events throughout the day, the comedy night was the best way to end the show, to take away all the exhaustion and fill it with a new zeal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font-weight-light&quot;&gt;
With the success of last year’s comedy night, we are proud to say that this year too, we will be inviting a comedian for the fest! The comedian will soon be revealed, but till then mark your calendars and get ready to fall out of your seats laughing! It’s going to be WILD!

&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font-weight-light&quot;&gt;
These walls barricade our actions and imagination. However, it’s only a matter of time before you realise the existence of the palisades! This Esya we intend to step beyond these walls, and create an ambience which propels many to push their limits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font-weight-light&quot;&gt;
Techfusion - Tracing the distant, the theme of Esya’19, too pushes us as a college to become more than what may already be. IIIT Delhi isn’t just a technical college, but over the years we are endeavouring to combine various fields with technology; to shine light on some of the hidden gems, and bring out their true worth which is lost in today’s tech pollution. As the tech cells spread in every field around us, it is required that one must have the skills to explore the synthesis. It is this synthesis which will lead to further development.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font-weight-light&quot;&gt;
Over the past few years, the college has introduced some new, unique synthesised programs, in which the industries lack yet have an essential need for. Esya’19 plans on bringing these synthesised programs as additional events, which will give way to a new dimension as compared to the levelled fests held over the previous years. We aim for simplicity and to bring out profundity of our vision in a two day technical fest - Esya. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font-weight-light&quot;&gt;
Ranging from intense coding competitions to Non-Tech Events, from RoboJam to Biowhiz, it’s a fest that one cannot miss! It’s a ticket out of your mundane routine; a rollercoaster ride with 360 degree loops as one rushes around exploring the fest and themselves. The fest will not only be entertaining but also give you a better understanding of where your interests lie; a lucid vision.
