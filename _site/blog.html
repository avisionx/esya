These walls barricade our actions and imagination. However, it’s only a matter of time before you realise the existence of the palisades! This Esya we intend to step beyond these walls, and create an ambience which propels many to push their limits.
</p>
<p class="font-weight-light">
Techfusion - Tracing the distant, the theme of Esya’19, too pushes us as a college to become more than what may already be. IIIT Delhi isn’t just a technical college, but over the years we are endeavouring to combine various fields with technology; to shine light on some of the hidden gems, and bring out their true worth which is lost in today’s tech pollution. As the tech cells spread in every field around us, it is required that one must have the skills to explore the synthesis. It is this synthesis which will lead to further development.
</p>
<p class="font-weight-light">
Over the past few years, the college has introduced some new, unique synthesised programs, in which the industries lack yet have an essential need for. Esya’19 plans on bringing these synthesised programs as additional events, which will give way to a new dimension as compared to the levelled fests held over the previous years. We aim for simplicity and to bring out profundity of our vision in a two day technical fest - Esya. 
</p>
<p class="font-weight-light">
Ranging from intense coding competitions to Non-Tech Events, from RoboJam to Biowhiz, it’s a fest that one cannot miss! It’s a ticket out of your mundane routine; a rollercoaster ride with 360 degree loops as one rushes around exploring the fest and themselves. The fest will not only be entertaining but also give you a better understanding of where your interests lie; a lucid vision.

Last year, we kick-started Esya with our very own rising star, Nitin Mandal for a comedy and fun filled night! 
</p>
<p class="font-weight-light">
<i>“For him, life is all about stories that make others laugh. Not that the highs and lows of finding his footing in the fledgeling field of stand-up comedy deterred 24-year-old Nitin Mandal. He literally laughed his way through and is today a well-known comedian in the Capital’s stand-up circuit.”</i> -  Insider
</p>
<p class="font-weight-light">
<i>“Being the badshaah of sarcasm, he can tickle your funny bone with his relationship stories and real-life experiences. Nitin has performed on the popular hit Red FM show Comedy ka Ghanta. His comedy sets come with a seatbelt warning though, because you may fall out of your seats laughing.”</i> - BookMyShow
</p>
<p class="font-weight-light">
The experience, as all who attended would agree, was entertaining and filled with laughter all around. After the exhausting yet indulging events throughout the day, the comedy night was the best way to end the show, to take away all the exhaustion and fill it with a new zeal. 
</p>
<p class="font-weight-light">
With the success of last year’s comedy night, we are proud to say that this year too, we will be inviting a comedian for the fest! The comedian will soon be revealed, but till then mark your calendars and get ready to fall out of your seats laughing! It’s going to be WILD!

Without successful events, without event heads with critical thinking and without a hardworking team we cannot have a triumphant tech fest.
</p>
<p class="font-weight-light">
A college fest is ever evolving process, there is always something new in the succeeding version especially in prestigious engineering colleges like IIIT Delhi, where our constant aim is to make the next fest better than the previous ones. We always tend to come up with something modish, distinct and unusual. But with parallel to that our main events are equally interesting and are a major crowd-puller. One of them is HuntIT which is basically a treasure quester or fortune hunter event in which you are given some hints and using those you have to complete the given task. It's a non-tech event so no discrimination at all on the basis of tech background! HuntIT constitutes of two phases, where the first day is limited to only IIITD walls and the next day the limit extends to whole Delhi region.
</p>
<p class="font-weight-light">
Another major event is Robowars. As the name suggests, it consists of two teams in opposition per match with their own version of robots. During the event, opposite teams try to tackle each other's robots which usually wired control. It's a Robotics event with the main aim to appreciate the students who have a knack for robotics with some healthy competition. Circuitrix is another major event in Esya from electronics discipline with the aim to provoke the idea of analysis and design of both digital and analog circuits. It has two versions - circuitrix for college students and circuitrix jr for school students.This event is for those who are really into designing, innovating or renovating the ideas revolving around circuits.
</p>
<p class="font-weight-light">
A tech fest would not be a productive fest if it doesn't include the generation and floatation of new groundbreaking ideas. To fulfill this requirement we have a very interesting event HackIIITD. It's an overnight hack marathon which involves creating a prototype of a software idea which will eventually lead to change in the tech industry more on positive note. We also have oconanother Coding event Procon which just like circuitrix, has two versions, one for the college students and other for the school students. It's an ACM ICPC styled online programming contest which means any person around the globe can participate in the contest.
</p>
<p class="font-weight-light">
These events not only define Esya but also make sure that people involving in it give their 100% whether it is team organizing them or students taking part in them. Moreover, these events not only look cool, but are equally challenging. But at the end of the day if we achieve something new and productive, it is worth the move and this is what we expect from each event in Esya.
