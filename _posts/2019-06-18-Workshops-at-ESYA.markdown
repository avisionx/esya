Esya provides a platform for those with ideas and for those who can use those ideas to develop something new. Ideas related to social media which directly or indirectly affects your life on day to day basis. But what happens when you become open and accessible to all about your relationship, health, occupation, etc through these media channels. You use these media channels with a believe that you are controlling your personal information and that is where cyber security comes in.

Esya is the amalgamation of groundbreaking ideas and mind-blowing results which eventually leads to synthesis of what we dreamt about couple of years ago and directs what could constitute our future.  Various workshops on topics shared above plus some interesting topics like aeromodeling, android app development, robotics IOT, etc will be conducted which will attract many great minds. These things affect us on day to day basis and are gradually becoming a basic need to a larger section of society. Many competitions are going to be held this time with their main focus to share different innovative ideas and also to have a healthy competition.
